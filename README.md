These files include the Java, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript code for a website I developed during my Web Technologies course. The project was created using Adobe Dreamweaver, with the server hosted and managed in the AWS Console.

This project involved implementing a wide range of features, including:
  
  -Form validation (ensuring user input is accurate and complete)
  -JavaScript events, decisions, and loops for dynamic and interactive functionality
  -Front-end and back-end development, integrating various technologies
  -PHP form methods, including handling POST and GET requests
  -Password hashing and user authentication for secure access
  -jQuery for efficient DOM manipulation and enhanced user experience

Unfortunately, due to concerns about ongoing AWS charges, the server has been terminated and is no longer live or accessible online. However, the source files remain available for review and demonstration.
